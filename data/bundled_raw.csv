Emerson Community Experience,0
How could Emerson engage you in building a stronger inclusive and equitable community?,0
"Discuss racism, anti-Semitism all forms of discrimination pro-actively. A consistent and educational campaign for staff, faculty and students",1
Regular communication,0
give staff time for this work,0
Engagement,0
Transparent and consistent support for marginalized students,0
"Send a message from the top of the organization that Emerson trusts its faculty and staff, and is dedicated to providing resources and flexibility to support integrating a diverse pool of talent.",0
I feel like the College has done a good job of engaging with me in this capacity.,0
I think students are engaged or would be more engaged if it felt like we were being listened to and saw change first hand. Words only take you so far,0
Showing up,0
"I wish I had a good answer for this. People are exhausted and burned out in our 3rd pandemic year. Everyone is trying to push through, hoping for a break to recharge and imagine.",0
Engage from the perspective of staff,0
Invest in staff,0
"specific but by allowing us to zoom into class especially when exposed or infected. absolutely unacceptable that I had to choose between my VERY expensive education and keeping my community safe. extremely ableist, inequitable, and immoral",0
I value social interactions with my peers especially who share my identity and often times I am unaware who they are because I am usually an uncommon identity in my classes. I would love to meet with other BIPOC students and be more involved.,0
"Compensate work that supports social justice, equity, and justice (e.g. compensate staff/students/faculty for participation on an extra committee or extra obligation)",0
"Student, faculty, staff are often viewed as three separate components/communities. There could be more collaboration between the three so all moving forward together and more supporting each other in getting the goals accomplished.",0
How can Emerson engage me?,0
"hiring more diverse staff, building promotion paths to retain them",1
Identify the gaps. (eg When had the Pres. last met with the staff?),0
Give us the time and money to do this.,0
Literature is available that describes Restorative Justice and Trauma-Informed Practices (not just teaching). I'd like to see the college invest in figuring out what potential those models hold and how it could work within a college setting.,0
just do it already,0
"Employ the ""curricula"" you teach and posted words in practice not just on social media",0
Restorative Justice,0
What are we trying to achieve,0
spend the money to support the community,0
By compensating everyone (especially diverse colleagues of color) appropriately for their labor.,0
Actually take exit interview seriously and enact changes based on that feedback.,0
"When elements of the college are told their efforts are inadequate for disabled or medically compromised people, there should be a solution provided that is not dehumanizing, does not require staff to jump through hoops.",0
"Emerson needs to engage diverse students, faculty, and staff (particularly of color) and enact changes based on their experiences instead of just creating new review committees.",0
"time needs to be made, like this survey, for staff to think through these subject",0
provide specific examples of policies and practices to change,0
"Yes, I hope specific policy and practice changes will come from BRE's work.",0
Start Staff Training,0
Get staff to recognize and report inequity,0
Individuals DO have an imporant part in this,0
"Compensation, Recognition & Appreciation",0
"stop raising tuition, take COVID more seriously, take concerns from BIPOC students more seriously",1
Willing to provide opinions and work towards end goal,0
By compensating me appropriately for my work,0
Community Members cannot work for change if they are scraping by,0
So tired.,0
Evident need to reduce community fatigue,0
me too,0
Providing more options for classes that double as requirements that focus on diversity and equity,0
Diversifying the classroom,0
Emerson-sponsored events that celebrate many different cultures,0
Agreed,0
Really look at everyone,0
please flesh out,0
establish task forces/committees responsible for creating measurable goals/timelines with representation from students/faculty/staff,0
Emerson needs to create an environment that is more results-focused on many levels.,0
There already are committees and groups and a lot of it is really performative and nothing gets done,0
"I think the really important part of this is ""measurable goals,"" because Emerson really likes to create task forces only to produce statements like ""we will try REALLY hard not to be racist anymore,"" without creating any concrete rulings""",0
This is already happening and it's not enough,0
Come together to listen to all voices.,0
There appears to be a disconnect between the equity values Emerson espouses and the student experience. Why do you think this is?,0
Students are treated like the enemies instead of the customers,0
The College really needs to look into and understand where the anti-sematic and racial comments are originating.,0
Unsure,0
not enough staff,0
Disconnect,0
"Students experience Emerson in different ways and we need better resources, services and systems to aid all students.",0
"We have a lot of wonderful idealist/visionary leaders, but fewer realists dedicated to implementation. We need a good balance of both.",0
I think the College can do better at sharing their story and the change they are working to enact. I don't think students are always aware of what is going on behind the scenes.,0
Emerson can not continue to be all talk we need to see real change. We need action.,0
Lack of Accountability & Support,0
"We live in a capitalistic white supremacist society. People are trying to make changes, but laws, culture and capitalism push against them.",0
Disconnect,0
the university is not talking to students enough; the decision makers are widely older white men,1
Students may possibly be unaware the efforts Emerson faculty are making. If they are not aware of the processes and changes in place they may not connect it to their personal Emerson experience.,0
Power doesn't want to give up power,0
"There should be more transparency about what has happened, what is happening, and what Emerson's plans are for the future",0
Emerson is highly reactive vs. proactive when it comes to equity,0
The staff and faculty tasked to create spaces based in equity aren't living up to those values,0
Sometimes what we can deliver doesn't match up with student expectations. And sometimes we just get it wrong.,1
"Emerson sets lofty standards and goals, but does not provide funding or support to meet them.",0
"""Caring"" takes space, time, and energy. These values will not trickle down if faculty, staff, and students continue to be overworked.",0
Those closest to pain not closest to power,0
administration unwilling to make systemic changes and rather relegates the issue to individual people and opportunities,0
not investing in equity and justice work at the college,0
not following through with addressing student demands,0
Lack of care/understanding/concern,0
A certain lack of understanding or engagement by those who make decisions at the college,0
The action does not meet needs,0
"Decisions are made with money as the primary motivating factor, instead of people.",0
"Student feedback and reports of their experience don't seem to be taken seriously, and future students are discouraged from reporting/sharing because of the poor past experiences of others.",1
"Emerson may say that it espouses certain values, but it does very little to actually back them up with action. There seems to be a disconnect because there is a disconnect.",0
can't be all things to all people,0
lack of communication,0
Administration talks a nice talk but is slow to enact actual change,0
You can't have it both ways,0
Changes takes time; students arenâ€™t always aware of what is happening to create change,1
Poor communication isn't an excuse,0
Support throughout,0
Lack of understanding,0
It is easy to espouse ideals without actually following through on them. This seems to be the student experience - Emerson has great ideas but fails to put many in place,0
Performance and Branding,0
Emerson's perception of equity is a business model and a marketing strategy,0
Bingo,0
"Students, faculty, and staff are not held accountable for their inequitable actions",0
"Accountability and consequences go hand in hand, without consequences-how does the behavior change",0
Accountability is key because without it inequity is rampant,0
"because at the end of the day, it's clear that Emerson is first and foremost a business, dedicated to making money, rather than education",0
"If it doesn't make money, it can't pay for innovative faculty who advance equity or offer more scholarships, or seek to expand the trainings and practices needed to become more accessible. How EC seeks money and uses it matters, however.",0
"Capitalism doesn't exclude equity, compassion or awareness",0
Emerson exists in a capitalistic society,0
Money,0
We need to listen to what students are saying about their experiences. And then create a means to improve what is not working.,1
Student Voices,0
Marketing vs reality,0
How can Emerson improve diversity and equity at the college?,0
Hire diverse staff on the admission team.,0
Tolerance for different points of view. Respect for all people. Even those with whom you disagree,1
Increase wages and financial aid,1
Past harm needs to be addressed at new social justice ctr,0
More scholarships,0
More access,0
Transparency on out-of-pocket costs for classes; additional emergency aid; industry connections for first-gen/low-income students,1
"Management training, providing resources for flexibility and integration of diverse faculty/staff, trust employees",1
"recruiting, hiring, supporting, connecting",1
Identifying and eliminating barriers for success,0
"I'm no expert but as a queer, trans, learning disabled, jewish student I want to see people like me and people nothing like me represented. International media and literature should be normal in a classroom setting. 0 tolerance for hate.",1
hire more BIPOC professors and give them the resources they need,1
provide more economic resources for students,0
Connection Across Depts,0
"Everyone will want to say training/workshops, but let's be real about what sitting through a session can & cannot do. I think the real answer is culture change and setting base expectations (which is squishy and nebulous and hard to put on a checklist.)",0
Improving equity,0
More need-based scholarships (NOT the honors program! which already disadvantages students),0
invest more money in programs and students that are advocating for equity; giving more financial aid (or how about lowering tuition significantly bc its ridiculous); hiring more diverse staff (most of my profs are white men),1
normalize disability,0
Center folx most marginalized,0
"Open spaces for online students of color to connect, such as a student chapter of NBASLH or discipline specific organization in a student's field of study.",0
Hire more administrative staff so they aren't burnt out,0
Build more support systems for marginalized students,0
Create transparent and formal processes for how bias reports are handled at Emerson,0
Ensure faculty are prepared to facilitate dialogue in a diverse classroom and support marginalized students,0
Recruit and admit more BIPOC students,0
Create more pathways (like EmersonWrites/Emerson Theater) for students at younger ages to be exposed to communication and the arts fields they may not otherwise have access to. More financial aid needed.,0
What can Emerson do?,0
give the new VP for Equity and Social Justice a significant budget - money talks and makes things happen,0
All encompassing approach to DEI,0
"Examine exit interviews for identified areas of failure, and build plans to repair",0
FUND the initiatives that come out of these listening sessions. It is not enough to assign these initiatives to current staff with no additional funding or shifting of workload.,0
Greater exploration of the impact and possibilities of the Board of Trustees and their stances on pursuing equity at Emerson.,0
I don't hear much about equity and the needs of our grad or commuter students but would like to.,0
The students have already provided several detailed lists on how we can address these issues,0
Accountability from the top down,0
Employing people who care,0
Identify ownership of issues,0
This question has already been answered,0
"Mandatory, rigorous diversity, equity, and bias training for every entering employee, and frequent required refreshers.",0
Board of Trustees needs to fundraise and allot more dollars to full scholarships specifically meant to recruit and be able to retain diverse students.,0
Actually pursue diversity and equity with pro-active action. Recruit diverse faculty and staff and pay them what their labor is worth (and equitably with their colleagues).,1
more resources are needed to get Emerson where it wants to be,0
Continue Hiring efforts and Start with the promised trainings,0
"Training absolutely matter and should be in place. I wonder, though, how accountability and infrastructure can help what is learned during training to take root?",0
Diversity Training,0
Financial Investment,0
allow student workers to work above 20 hr limit (grad students take few classes and need the hours!!!),0
more scholarship money for students financially struggling,0
provide more scholarship funds for students.,0
Putting words into action,0
Values and vision match,0
By taking a thorough look at how EC is upholding the tenets of White Supremacy Culture and how they can transform the college into a space where everyone can thrive,0
Consult students about mandated procedures like weekly COVID testing,0
invites students with chronic illness to share experiences/hardships,0
Not relevant to the conversation,0
Accountability and Resources,0
Retention of BIPOC staff and faculty,0
Reframing/redesigning DiversityEdu for students and equity training for faculty,0
Training=Awareness=Change,0
I would add performance expectations/accountability/growth tracking or something similar here because awareness doesn't always lead to change- especially if the resources or agency to make changes is limited.,0
Firing tenured professors who students have spoken out against for their inequitable teaching,0
Makes space to hire more equitable professors,0
Providing financial aid for marginalized and in-need students,0
Improves retention of marginalized students,0
"literally be willing to make changes from the top up, rather than just making groups to discuss issues that don't solve any actual issues",0
Holds administration responsible,0
Give me back my name,0
give them back their name,0
Reinvent higher education,0
What exactly does this mean? What steps do you have to take to reinvent higher education?,0
Not Much Here,0
Hire and retain more diverse faculty and staff,0
Retention is key!,0
Grow its endowment to be able to offer more scholarship $,0
What are your top three diversity and equity concerns at Emerson?,0
"Equal pay, titles that reflect the work being done, a defensive posture whenever issues are brought up",1
Welcoming and Respectful Environment. A willingness to be open and non-judgmental,1
"Fair wages for staff and faculty, generous student financial aid, increased diversity in permanent faculty and staff",1
student activism= better results than staff activism,0
Diversity concerns,0
Faculty,0
Support for low-income students; diverse faculty; diverse class options,1
Transparency; Resources/Flexibility; Culture that values results,1
sustaining successes and momentum,0
Hiring and retaining staff of color; identifying and addressing barriers for participation in abroad/domestic programs;,1
Accessibility inside and outside the classroom. I haven't had a single professor of color yet (although I'm only a freshman). The curriculum is still very euro centric,0
turning point usa,0
lack of accessibility,0
Burnout,0
"1) Supporting students once they're here, especially financially 2) continuing iterative improvements and not losing momentum 3) universal design for acccessiblity (and the funding to accomplish it!)",1
Committing to DEI longterm,0
Concerns,0
Can we see the data on where we are?,0
how white it is (lack of access for students of color); how expensive it is (related to whiteness); too much talk and not enough action,1
EC not adding positions to support its initiatives,0
top 3 diversity and equity concerns at Emerson,0
CSD coursework that prepares clinicians for assessment and treatment in the multicultural landscape of America at all levels of therapy in every setting for all ages.,0
"Racial justice/inclusion of multiracial/mixed-race perspectives in conversations about race, accessibility/disability justice, and equity for trans and non-binary people",1
"Too reactive, no foundational curriculum, people working in silos to get the work moving forward",1
diversity and equity concerns,1
"hiring, retaining, promoting staff",1
"Inclusive recruitment, inclusive retention, and structural support for advancement",1
"financial aid, staff, faculty",1
That student demands are not legally feasible; that community members will not be held accountable for their actions; that the college is not willing to FUND these initiatives,1
"Scholarships, Curriculum, Staffing",1
"Accessibility, racial injustice, white supremacy, transphobia",1
Culturally diverse representation & inclusion,0
Practice what you teach,0
One size does not fit all,0
"1: presenting an unintentionally unwelcome environment, 2: under- or over-representing BIPOC experience on campus, 3: institutional contraction and stagnation due to talented people leaving",1
Equity requires accountability,0
"Accessibility, supporting economic diversity, and addressing intersectionality",1
Lack of compassion and lack of proactive accommodations for disabled or immunocompromised community members (particularly in regards to the pandemic).,0
"Severe lack of adequate scholarship dollars to recruit and retain diverse students, especially from underserved populations, and a lack of support once they are at Emerson.",1
"I agree. I hope the Office of Student Access and Student Belonging gets the ""startup"" resources it needs and that it's role and funding will be re-evaluated in order for it to have a deeper impact.",0
"â€‹Recent exodus of faculty and staff of color, especially tenured/longstanding community members.",0
I agree,0
diversity of socio-economic backgrounds,0
Agreed. The additional costs beyond tuition and housing should also be considered.,0
"social media and sound bites sometimes take the place of thorough discussion, different constituencies present contrary goals, lack of trust",1
Faculty and Staff Training in Disability advocacy; HR recognition of Mental Health needs; Anti-Racism training for Faculty/Staff,1
Building upon what is already there,0
training,0
I agree and would add that staff may want and need training that would allow them to meet newly identified needs or circumstances.,0
student support/personnel,0
Lack of college wide training,0
faculty & students of color,0
Retention of staff,0
advancement opportunities,0
living wages,0
diversity in new staff/faculty hires,0
student life (microaggressive and macroaggressive behavior),0
Faculty resistance to equity work,0
the lack of accessibility afforded to students,0
transphobia (esp towards binary trans people),0
3) Grow the endowment,0
2) Examination of curriculum,0
Lack of focus on disability,0
priorities of new VP of social justice,0
Financial resources,0
Top 3,0
Diversity at all levels of staffing,0
"Consultation of student body in decision-making that affects students directly (COVID testing, etc.)",0
"Accountability, Resources, Concrete Change",1
Resources need to be attached to real needs,0
"Accountability, Resources, Connection to Larger Society",0
Acceptance and retention of BIPOC students,0
racism,0
Time to Walk the Walk,0
Smoke & Mirrors,0
We need more diversity and equity. Our community still lacks these.,0
Students of color who Emerson accepts get more money from other schools,0
Boston Public School students,0
1) Accepting more BIPOC students,0
"Along with acceptance of BIPOC students comes the retention, which includes providing financial assistance as well",0
What has been most impactful about Emersonâ€™s efforts to build a diverse and equitable community?,0
I do not know. At times it does not feel very inclusive. It is amazing to me that lip service is given to being inclusive but there seems to a lot bad behavior that does not feel welcoming or respectful.,0
Unsure,0
"explain ""experience""",0
Leadership,0
Faculty,0
Asking faculty to take a critical dive into their classes and recognize where there is room for improvement,0
"Former President Pelton's words on diversity have been inspiring, moving and motivating. Now we need to put words into action.",0
learning,0
I think we have worked hard to expand the reach of the ELA program to a more diverse group of students. We have begun to set-up partnerships with Boston office that can help us in our recruiting efforts.,0
Emerson still has lots of work to do but I appreciated the fact that the college didn't turn a blind eye to what happened in my class where my prof was blatantly anti semitic,0
the diversification of reading materials,0
Listening Skills,0
"The fact that we don't have to argue about whether diversity/inclusion is a good thing or not. We can start from the basis that it is, and disagree what to do next. True, that's a really low bar, but one that is not met in a lot of places.",0
Equitable Community,0
Emerson listening to the complaints of students,0
I've been educated about some issues?,0
"Diversity training, gender neutral bathrooms, not enough but",1
seeing how hard it is to do!,0
Changemakers,0
"The DEI initiatives, assemblies and forums that allow students and faculty communicate about this issue.",0
ArtsEmerson creating and hosting Mr. Joy for incoming students during Orientation,0
Student Accessibility Services and the work that they do! Too often diversity and inclusion is focused more on race than on all types of inclusion. The SAS staff is small but mighty and continue to highlight inclusion in different forms.,0
What has been most impactful about Emersonâ€™s efforts to build a diverse and equitable community?,0
hiring of Lee Pelton and Sylvia Spears,0
Creating and hosting the Teach In On Race,0
"Highlighting issues that need to be addressed, but not necessarily addressing them effectively",0
increasing the student loan and faculty salaries budgets and recruiting admissions/resumes from schools and communities with diverse student bodies,1
"hiring, training, and financial aid",1
Iterative Process,0
Emerson is failing at accessibility when students literally told us exactly what they needed this semester,0
still missing the mark,0
Lack of application in practice,0
Developing an open dialogue about DEI,0
DEI training for all new students,0
Could use regular and consistent followup,0
Thoughtful Concern,0
the people already doing the work,0
Scholarship funds for underserved populations to actually get diverse perspectives in the door,0
More full scholarships,0
"I have yet to see any tangible, significant or meaningful impact or outcome from any initiative that's come from the ""institution."" The most impact I see is from the personal connections and relationships that I have sought out during my time here",0
recognition of faults,0
Student Activism,0
Student voices,0
â€‹Extra Effort to Interview More Minority Candidates,0
Frequent dialogue,0
"Emerson has clearly made a real effort to address the student demands and other feedback around equity and inclusion, including the Teach-In on Race, expanding the number of positions that focus on access and belonging, etc.",1
Responsiveness,0
Support from all areas of the college to make this a top priority,0
Support from the community,0
New staff to support DEI,0
Additional staff needed to support additional student needs!!!,0
Having multiple positions and offices responsible for this work.,0
A coherent strategy of how those individuals and offices work individually and collectively is needed. That does entail collaboration where it makes sense but also I don't think there's a clear understanding of how the various people/offices,0
Multiple positions/offices disadvantage,0
Multiple positions/offices advantage,0
"Support in recruiting and retaining students, staff and faculty of color.",0
Tracking progress with quantitative data,0
"Data speaks, we need more dissemination of it",0
The students have moved the College forward.,0
Student voice,0
"Emerson's initiative after the ESOC Week of Action. There is still a lot to be done and it is not perfect, but in my time here, that has been the most impactful",0
the lack of true commitment to enacting change,0
Can you elaborate?,0
"I have seen over the past few years, from students, staff, and faculty, a real effort to come together and discuss different ways to make our campus more diverse and equitable. I have seen movement in this direction, but there is a lot more work to do.",0
Continuing to hire a more diverse faculty,0
Diversifying Hiring,0
What do you appreciate most about your Emerson experience?,0
Helping Students/Families,0
My relationships with my colleagues and my client groups.,0
Collaborating with creative people,0
I appreciate the variety of opportunities that are made for the students. I appreciate the hands on learning experience in the different courses and activities.,1
not sure,0
My access to resources and a network I wouldn't have at any other school,1

Creative Environment,0
Forging new friendships and curricular projects with other faculty members,0
"The smaller size, the ability to innovate",1
I really appreciate the collaborative nature in which students and staff/faculty are encouraged to work.,0
I enjoy the amount of different opportunities there are for me to get involved with various organizations. I appreciate that the college strives to better itself.,1
Emerson Experience,0
The Resources,0
Passion of Community,0
Emerson appreciation,0
"That this is a community that believes in and tries to practice values like inclusion, belief in science, antiracism, etc. We fail, because we're human and humans always fall short - but I really appreciate that we start from a place of effort.",0

Emerson Experience,0
Admin Assoc,0
I like my team and my role,0
The Staff and Students,0
I appreciate the access to resources and alumni that will almost guarantee me work after college. I appreciate the amount of knowledge I have gained and will continue to gain that is preparing me for my career as a filmmaker.,1
Awestruck,0
I have most appreciated the open door/inbox approach towards students that allows them to approach instructors in a low pressure atmosphere. I feel as though I have been respected by all faculty members and encouraged to continue to grow academically.,1
We have good people who want to make positive change happen.,0
I love that being creative and bold in my work is encouraged and valued.,0
I appreciate that we are encouraged to innovate and continually raise the bar on what we do at Emerson.,0
"I appreciate the opportunity to connect with such creative, passionate, and inspiring students",0
i appreciate that I can have an impact on students AND colleagues,0
I love being able to connect with students and faculty and help them. I think there is a sense of community among staff members that I appreciate. I think the benefits and the way staff are treated are better than a lot of places I've worked.,1
The students are the best part of Emerson,0
What do you appreciate most about your Emerson experience?,0

What I Appreciate Most,0
The students,0
"The staff I work with directly are creative, hardworking, and engaged. They are always willing to collaborate and lend a hand when needed. Their focus is on creating the best experience and environment possible for the constituents we serve.",1
"Despite my own experiences, I recognize that staff in other areas than my mown have dealt with microaggressions, interference with their work, and have reported that their team was not receptive to proposed moves towards equity.",0
I agree with this.,0
Acceptance and tolerance,0
What is this one for?,0
This form is not accessible enough,0
"The students are infinitely creative. They also hold high expectations for their education, and the environment in which it is delivered. I learned as much from students as I did in the classroom.",1
"I appreciate being around other creative people who see the world through a similar lens and who don't feel beholden to doing things the ""proper"" way if it doesn't work for us.",0
clear articulation of values,0
The Students at Emerson,0
Appreciate My Colleagues,0
Passion & Creativity,1

I like the immersive and hands-on experience Emerson provides for its students,0
"Positive, but needs more consistency",0
consistency- more-- in what specific areas?,0
Lack of context: What about the experience is positive?,0
. . .,0
Not Helpful,0
We Talk the Talk,0
"an important emphasis- people care about words and learning, but it can be just lip service and isn't the same as walking the walk",0
Words matter,0
Connections,0
"I most appreciate the opportunity to be in spaces, which includes the classroom, to get to know people with different backgrounds and perspectives. I try to create spaces in which students feel comfortable sharing their identities and experiences.",0
